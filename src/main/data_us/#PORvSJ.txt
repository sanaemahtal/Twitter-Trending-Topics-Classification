Red card for Valeri! Oh boy, it's all going off late on. Still about four mins for #Quakes74 to lay siege to that Portland goal... #PORvSJ
About two minutes of stoppage time, not including the time spent on that fight, and now the Timbers have 10 men. #PORvSJ #RCTID
No argument on the penalty to Borchers. It was a foul by a very tired player. #PORvSJ #RCTID
What in the hell was Bingham thinking. Holy crap, Valeri with the red. The end of this match is insane. #PORvSJ
90+5' Yellow card issued to David Bingham. #Quakes74 #PORvSJ
Diego Valeri asking for further suspension after protesting to leave the pitch after the red card. #PORvSJ
It should be at least 10 minutes of stoppage time #PORvSJ
Could be wrong but I think borchers was just trying to swap jerseys with wondo. #PORvSJ
And a fight breaks out. Lots of pushing, shoving and boos. Diego Valeri just got a second yellow for a red. #RCTID #PORvSJ
Bingham v Borchers. I'd watch that. #PORvSJ #Quakes74
Hey only reason Borchers of @TimbersFC pulled Wondolowski jersey in box he was still in pain from previous injury #HelpMeUp #RCTID #PORvSJ
8 fucking minutes!? #PORvSJ
San Jose's throwing everyone forward right now. #PORvSJ
Must have fallen asleep for at least 4 minutes of the match...8 minutes extra time? WHY. #PORvSJ
Not sure how you dispute that penalty, Borchers. You had the back of his jersey up at his clavicle. #PORvSJ
Nice chip @KipColvey. Definitely a penalty on Timbers. #PORvSJ
Wondolowski, that's cheeky. Wondo establishes daylight and moves clear of Ante Razov in the all-time scoring charts. #Quakes74 #PORvSJ
Roses your hand if you wish jack had made that 3rd goal #PORvSJ
Boy that McInerney miss is going to be hurting if SJ find an equalizer....what this league couldnt do w/a lil more quality #PORvSJ
Wondo 115. Ball don't lie.  8 minutes of stoppage time just got interesting #PORvSJ #Quakes74
Okay I am way angrier about the 8 MINUTES of stoppage time than that PK, seriously #RCTID #PORvSJ
Wondo used to be so bad at PKs. Buried something like 12 in a row now - improved so much. Keep working at your craft, kids. #PORvSJ
Eight minutes of stoppage time?!?!? Something weird is gonna happen. #PORvSJ
4th official indicates that there will be a third half of stoppage time #PORvSJ #RCTID
Wondo with the goal. These final eight minutes are gonna be fun..... #PORvSJ
Was watching the grappling of Borchers and Wondolowski for a while before the ball was put in. All over him, clear pen. #Quakes74 #PORvSJ
What the hell is going on with Nat Borchers lately? #PORvSJ
heh wondo is still a fucking punk #PORvSJ
Wondolowski draws the foul from Nat Borchers and the penalty is converted. 2 1 Timbers #PORvSJ
HOLY!!!! 8 minutes? That's insane #PORvSJ
90' 8 minutes of stoppage time added. #PORvSJ #Quakes74
What is happening @TimbersFC?!! 2nd GK Gleeson down but ok Borchers slowly getting up #NoMoreInjuries #VeryScary #RCTID #PORvSJ
90' PENALTY to the Quakes as Wondo is pulled down! #PORvSJ #Quakes74
Borchers has been immense so far. A big reason why San Jose's off the scoresheet. #PORvSJ
YEAH PORTLAND LETS GET THAT W, TOUGH AF ðŸŒ² #PORvSJ
Portland looking very comfortable with the 2 0 lead. Excellent 2nd half. #PORvSJ
Peeking my head into Twitter to say that Jack McInerney owns Kip Colvey. Both his goals against SJ have come by beating the rookie. #PORvSJ
@TimbersFC is having a pretty good game. Maybe this game turns the season around #PORvSJ
Borchers fights Wondo, falls into own keeper, so WONDO gets called for foul?
2-0 87'
#PORvSJ
Not cool Wondo. Pushed Nat right into Gleeson #PORvSJ
No moar injuries #PORvSJ
heh wondo with a big ol push off in the box there #RCTID #PORvSJ
Really impressed by Valentin tonight. Hopefully this is a sign of good things to come. #PORvSJ
86' #Quakes74 fighting late here! Dawkins creates some space in the box and takes a shot that sails just high. #PORvSJ
Dawkins is garbage. Tough game to be behind but worse to see him waste attacks. #PORvSJ #Quakes74
84' Portland sub: Jewsbury comes on for Grabavoy. #PORvSJ #Quakes74
Grabavoy makes way for Jewsbury as the Timbers look to see this one out 2-0 #PORvSJ
#Timbers are dominating this second half. Want to see Adi score again! :)  #PORvSJ #timbersarmy
#CalebPorter "No fucking way, man." #SJvPOR #PORvSJ #MLS #Adi
Surprised it took this long for MPG to come on. VS Backup keeper you want your best dead ball guy in. #PORvSJ #Quakes74
let's be real, there's still like 20 minutes left of this game #PORvSJ
Timbers still up 2-0 but San Jose's got a lot of fight left in them #PORvSJ
82' #Quakes74 sub: Matias Perez Garcia comes on for Fatai Alashe for the Quakes' final substitution. #PORvSJ
We are falling apart :( #PORvSJ
@timbersarmy call &amp; answer: You can't stop Us! We are the #RoseCity, sounds magical on the broadcast.  Dont ever stop #RCTID #PORvSJ
Valeri with an amazing through ball and McInerney was through on goal but somehow scuffed it wide. #PORvSJ
San Jose's really pushing for a goal here. This game is far from over. #PORvSJ
This is the best outside back performance from the timbers all season #PORvSJ
So...what I'm getting, @TimbersFC, is that mocking you in-game is a good thing? Motivating, perhaps? #RCTID #PORvSJ
Much better hustle from the Timbers in this second half. Wanting the ball. #PORvSJ
Innocence was lost... will he now be found #PORvSJ #rimshot #thatsthebestigot #wingingit #Quakes74
Dude's name is Innocent? Just 1 name? Like he's Madonna? Like he's a pope? #PORvSJ #RCTID
