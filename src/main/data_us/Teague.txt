@trevor_teague @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora @NatEnquirer 

I destroyed the very fabric of your argument and you type "so?" üëç
@AdamBomb7869 @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora @NatEnquirer resorting to insults because your argument is based on rumors..#fail
@trevor_teague @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora @CLIFFBELL888 

Just go away. You're not bringing anything to the table
@trevor_teague @AdamBomb7869 @nsroundtable @CarmineZozzora @CLIFFBELL888  
Good question!
@ejs1996 @CarmineZozzora @trevor_teague @NatEnquirer @nsroundtable 

I really believe they're sitting on negative Cruz info for the General.
Jeff Teague is tough in the playoffs
@CarmineZozzora @trevor_teague @NatEnquirer @AdamBomb7869 @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear the Dems are waiting on this til he is the candidate
@trevor_teague @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora @NatEnquirer 

Everyone I know named Trevor has been a complete ass fuck at life
@trevor_teague @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora @NatEnquirer 

Well she's named as a Cruz mistress
Teague Roast: @HuntFireShield only plays bot matches so that he can seem good at the game! #ROASTED
@AdamBomb7869 @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora @NatEnquirer thanks, but I'd rather trust news from mad magazine
@Doodles_F1 they gone go at it. My man Teague need to be more aggressive

My cats likes to sleep in our clean clothes so he always smells so good and I always cuddle and kiss himüòä
I love Hawks twitter relationship. The Teague-Vs Dennis debates are fun.
This lasagne I got from my job is hurtin the spot right now
@AGEofTOBEY I can see Teague there..I can see Bogut there bc Festus will get paid by GS. Yeah, Parsons needs to step it up
I'm getting Kylie so drunk Friday she not gone remember who she is üòúüòà
Teague Roast: @CatherineDatWiz is the worst Alistar ever! #ROASTED
This game might be out of hand.
@iamodus_ yea that's what hurt us. We just need an ezili/manhmni C &amp; teague/Conley type pg &amp; we'd be ok. Parsons is the wildcard
@AdamBomb7869 @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora lol yup! Just as funny as believing anything from national inquirer about Cruz
@steve21smith Jeff teague #undertherim w/behind the back, spin back lay on my Beantown boys on a great defender in avery bradley
Jeff Teague so slept on ü§ê
Bud on Teague after Bradley's injury: "Without him, Jeff may have gotten even more aggressive and found some situations that we like."
@ATLHAWKS_4LIFE we have the advantage on the Frontline. Teague's played well too but our bench has played like üí© since the 1st of April
@trevor_teague @nsroundtable @TheOregonBear @CarmineZozzora 

That's a really sweet made up meme.. Lol
Zaza Pachulia's head is too big for his face. It's the opposite of what @SheaSerrano said about Jeff Teague.
Avery Bradley going down is an absolute series changer. Nobody else on their team can guard Teague one on one.
@j_ober10 Jeff Teague and al keep Atlanta held down.
@ConradKaz @JalenMuhammad shouldn't count on that player. We have a healthy Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague, KK, &amp; Thabo this time. #Noted üìù tho
@jefteague team Teague
If AB is out, Teague is gonna toast us
That excuse "Dennis is young &amp;still developing" ain't gone work this year especially since y'all wanted to trade Teague &amp; have Dennis start.
@TEAGUE___ knock out
