The Celtics need to pick up a good center
@moeabu75 @ak_865 last time I checked Celtics beat OKC and Golden state at home. And pacers lit the Spurs up and beat OKC ü§îü§îü§îü§î
Got a ticket to the Sunday Celtics game and honestly I've never been more ready for anything
Gonna look forward to the sour grapes from Celtics affiliates.
@caitemclaughlin @celtics Almost happened!! Some horrid calls in the end. This team *CAN* do it though!! Next game is ours!! #GreenRunsDeep
@celtics what's with the green and black uniforms , the Celtics are green and white ,and our greedy asshole owner is gonna put adds on those
I am so proud of &amp; grateful for our #AtlantaHawks taking a WIN during the 2016 #NBAPlayoffs!Thats 1st Rnd Hm Game1 over the Boston Celtics!
Why tf did the celtics lose by 1 point
He's on the celtics now and it's our first playoff game. He can't defend, can't rebound, and he turns it over often. I wish we never signed‚Ä¶
And I'm shitty about the Celtics lost
@ItIsWhatItIsAnn is it weird even though I'm a parking Knicks fan I'm rooting for the Celtics right now?
@vargas0516 you mean the team the Celtics ended a home streak against?
Im losing hope about the injury of avery bradley. Celtics loss jst by 1pt.
I really like the hornets. Probably 2ns favorite team behind my Celtics for some reason
Celtics are taking heat because Evan Turner attempted the game-tying 3-pointer at the end of the game, but he was open. Take the open shot.
Celtics have to be pissed after coming back up and loss at the last second.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Decent start to the Playoffs today outside of Celtics losing, everything else went pretty much as expected. Raps losing OKC/GS smashing
I think the Celtics could win the eastern conference but I feel like lebron gonna kill it this year
Celtics win the series if Smart steps up, More IT4 flare screens, and Sully can keep up with Al.
Damn everybody but the Celtics getting blown out today üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@AnthonyLegarda you didn't like the Hawks/Celtics?
the @celtics lose a close one to the @ATLHawks in @PhilipsArena, the @okcthunder rout the @dallasmavs at @ChesapeakeArena. #NBAPlayoffs
@ak_865 win in the east. Celtics awful only have certain matchups they are good at. Pistons trash, heat hot garbage, east is trash
That weak and bias recap. If hadn't watched the game I would've thought the Celtics won. Piss poor @espn. Do better.
If Avery Bradley can't play no more for the Celtics tho the Celtics aren't making it past this first round
Celtics will win the series 4-2...
@Bulls_Jay who would we get from the Celtics ?
the Celtics game earlier was heartbreaking. hope my boy Bradley is good for the rest of the series.
Hawks and Celtics series gonna be the best series
Why does everyone on the Celtics have questionable haircuts? Are there no real barbers
The @SportsCenter highlight of Hawks-Celtics didn't have a single @ATLHawks basket in it. üòë
Hahahaha fuck the Celtics
am i petty/bitter if i hate the celtics just bc thats my ex's fav team? whatever idc fuck him and his dumbass fav team
huge blow for the Celtics if Bradley's injury is as bad as it seems
THE CELTICS GONE WIN THE EAST
@emmyxo1 @celtics all day üëåüèΩ
@jonamdall hopefully, but whatever happens at least the celtics aren't getting a lottery pick
Celtics could beat the Hawks very easily if they start strong
@TheJFKGamer @celtics I was really expecting them to come back and win like they did with the Heat
If it makes Raptors fans feel better, Celtics were over the foul limit in under 2 minutes to start the 3Q. #RTZ #WeTheNorth
1st day #NBAPlayoffs @warriors are gonna warriors a triller in @ATLHawks over @celtics @Raptors lost the @pacers is no brainer....
Honestly think the 06' - 07' Celtics would destroy the Warriors
The bad: Celtics lost, can't find my phone.

The good: Red Sox won, my landlord is GIVING me an apartment in Providence, Dodgers have life..
Can't be shocked or upset the Celtics lost when they no show the first half like that. Unacceptable effort
#Celtics SF Evan Turner started the 2nd half of today's Game 1 at SF, SF Jae Crowder to PF, PF Jared Sullinger to C, PF Amir Johnson 2 bench
The Celtics gone get right in a few years. Mark my word.
Hawks and Celtics are going to be the series to watch in round one.  With the possibility of seven games what's not to like.  Who wants it?
I highkey thought the Celtics were going to win lol
Looks like Celtics Hawks the only game worth watching thus far.
@Tha_Real_Tmoney @kylecrayton11 idk if the cavs make it this year! Hawks, heat, Celtics, Pacers, and Raptors are all capable of winning
Can't believe the #Celtics lost by one point. Any updates on #AveryBradley
Bradley got hurt? Greattt now the Celtics fans get the excuse they are gonna need :/
@T_Hardin99 you know what else is clutch? Not the Celtics tonight HHAAHAHHAHAHA
Celtics are so good with come backs, you'd think they would just be able to not go down by so much in the first place
I'm only salty the Celtics ain't win
I went to sleep because the Celtics were so bad and woke up 10 minutes ago. 5 minutes ago I got the Green Rock text from the Doo. It's lit.

@SportsCenter @espn translation, the Celtics are out the playoffs. He's one of their key players.
No real surprises today; Raptors game included. #Pacers will win that series. CELTICS n HAWKS will go the distance #NBAPlayoffs
@Kevern87 Eh, That was a bad game, the other games have been fine though. Celtics game was really good.
@roadrunnerbobby @KvngCameron the Miami Heat are better than the Boston no superstar having ass Celtics
@NBALatam @Al_Horford @ATLHawks @celtics #PlatanoPower let's go hawks
Horrible @NBA playoff opening. Thanks @ATLHawks and @celtics for trying the entire 48 minutes.
I miss the days of watching Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett play together for the Celtics
Special shout out to the @ATLHawks for winning the 1st game of the playoffs against the @celtics. Keep the momentum going and close the gap.
@CBMac84 Not good. If we're going to have a long series on our hands, which I hope we do, the Celtics need Avery Bradley.

Tough loss for the Celtics to Atlanta in the opener of that series. Hawks showing toughness too. Still think Boston wins that series in 6.
