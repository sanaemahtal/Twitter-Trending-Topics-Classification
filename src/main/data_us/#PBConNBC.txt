They robbed Radivoje wow PBC really come on #PBConNBC
Spence had no respect whatsoever for Algieri's power. He just bullied and battered him. 
#SpenceAlgieri #PBConNBC
Errol Spence Jr is that guy #PBConNBC
@ErrolSpenceJr is the truth! I thought it would be an @ChrisAlgieri win but how wrong was I? Utmost respect for Algieri. #ManDown #PBConNBC
Can I watch just one boxing card w/o blatant corruption involved? Browne had no business gettin the W, but he's "the bigger name"
#PBConNBC
I can't believe I missed #UFCTampa on FOX, watching #CNN's stale news &amp; #PBConNBC.ðŸ˜¡
Thurman nor Porter want it with Spence!#SpenceAlgieri #PBConNBC #MANDOWN #boxing #boxingnews #bigcardpromo #Realtalkboxing #fightnews #PBC
That referee's horrible call just cost a man the fight, that's unacceptable. On top of the terrible scoring. #PBConNBC #PBConDVR
I'll tell you guys this: I got free tkts to #SpenceAlgieri and got a free upgrade on top of the free tkts. #Boxing #BrooklynBoxing #PBConNBC
Felix Verdejo injured his left hand now that kid is not the same #SoloBoxeo #PBConNBC #Showsport
Boxing all over tonight #PBConNBC #UFConFOX #SoloBoxeo #SHOsports
Marcus Browne, serial hugger, wins by terrible split decision. I'm going to throw up. #PBConNBC
@ErrolSpenceJr was spectacular tonight! Fast, powerful hands, with great footwork, and head movement. #PBConNBC #boxing
Banging out my article on #PBConNBC for @TheFightCity
Shitty officiating in the light heavyweight fight. Your one job is to watch the fight, and you're day dreaming. #PBConNBC #PBConDVR
Spence Jr got next #PBConNBC #Boxing.
#UFCTampa #PBConNBC its awesome seeing combat sports trending on Twitter! #Bellator152 &amp; #GLORY29 happened today too! It was a day of fights
Glowacki earned every inch of the mile he had to hike against Cunningham. I wanna see more of these guys. #PBConNBC #PBConDVR
Great Night of Fight Sports!! #PBConNBC #UFConFOX #SoloBoxeo #SHOsports
Very nice card by @premierboxing on   @nbc! #PBConNBC #boxing
Damn Steve Cunningham is tough! #PBConNBC #PBConDVR
Smith need to let his hands go #RussellHyland #PBConNBC #boxing
Another example of why boxing has lost credibility, Browne gifted a decision vs Kalajdzic on #PBConNBC Atleast the @ufc gave us a good show.
Algieri's been in w/ Pacquiao, Khan, &amp; Provodnikov(??) &amp; survived .. but Errol Spence gave em that werq

#PBConNBC #SpenceAlgieri #Boxing
.@BCampbellESPN am I crazy 4 thinking that Spence could beat Kell Brook? I'm a big Brook fan, but this kid is special  #Boxing  #PBConNBC
Errol Spence just did what Pacquiao couldn't/wouldn't.. A VERY mature and clinical performance..This guy is legit. #SpenceAlgieri #PBConNBC
