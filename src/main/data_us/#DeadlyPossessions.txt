@Zak_Bagans Quote from #DeadlyPossessions "what would you feel if we all left?" (except Zak while Peggy watches?)
@Zak_Bagans feeling nauseous right now. this is insane. #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans After showing the dolls face my dog started to bark and the feeling in the room changed. Pretty intense stuff #deadlypossessions
That laugh though #DeadlyPossessions #Peggythedoll
Really want to watch the séance but I can't look at the TV cuz that fucking demon doll is @ the table *puts bag on head* #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans it's now been 2 hours since EP 3 and no one has uploaded, pray for Australia who don't get #DeadlyPossessions live
This is intense #DeadlyPossessions
not even watching when Peggy comes up, just listening lmao @Zak_Bagans @AaronGoodwin @BillyTolley @jaywasley  #DeadlyPossessions
Welp, I saw its face. #DeadlyPossessions I feel gassy now, burping. Is that a side effect?
@Zak_Bagans Did anyone else have pain in their Chest and Head, Dizziness when they saw Peggy the Doll? #DeadlyPossessions

Finally watching #DeadlyPossessions &amp; @Zak_Bagans that doll=anxiety when I see it. I'm having a bad anxiety attack right now even w/it gone!
Oop, the replay made me look at the doll's face, Migraine still hurts yet not by the doll. Still feel the same. #DeadlyPossessions
I'm not scared of dolls until now #DeadlyPossessions #peggydoll

Quote from #DeadlyPossessions "I felt it enter my body" @Zak_Bagans
#DeadlyPossessions @Zak_Bagans I'm not sure how I would handle the #PeggyTheDoll experience.  Hope she didn't follow you home
@Zak_Bagans #DeadlyPossessions #peggydoll I didn't feel rage or anger I felt sad &amp; sorry for her, I totally missed her story so maybe...???
I felt a little jumpy. And made sure the word  "respect" was running through my mind #PeggyReveal #DeadlyPossessions #GhostAdventures
@Zak_Bagans watching west coast block  of #DeadlyPossessions under my blankie-I was freezing during the #PeggytheDoll segment.

@Zak_Bagans the min sack came off my heart rate spike up then only dropped after #peggydoll  left the room #DeadlyPossessions
#DeadlyPossessions I looked at Peggy and had my rosary in my hand but now I'm scared to move around my house
Watching #DeadlyPossessions and I'm not going to lie, when Peggy's face was shown I got a headache and anxious @Zak_Bagans @AaronGoodwin
@Zak_Bagans  when the doll was showing. The face I really really did cover my face. Seriously I did. #DeadlyPossessions
I just saw Peggy's face i want to start crying and i have high anxiety, not cool #DeadlyPossessions

@Zak_Bagans can your body get extremely hot, and get blurry after seeing #PeggyTheDoll. throat hurts, Might not finish #DeadlyPossessions
Put a pillow over my face during Peggy's 10 seconds of fame.. My boyfriend wanted to be a tough guy though. #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans #DeadlyPossessions will have to wait until tomorrow... Almost peed myself 😨
@Zak_Bagans hmmm lots of strange feeling occurring with me right now after seeing Peggy. #DeadlyPossessions
Night's still young, but I think I'm fine. Covered my cat with a blanket during the reveal though, just to be safe. #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans @AaronGoodwin @BillyTolley  watching new #DeadlyPossessions show &amp; jw if Peggy The Doll will affect me at home watching this?? 😓
Catching up on #DeadlyPossessions I never heard of peggy the doll but the story is interesting @Zak_Bagans @AaronGoodwin
Wondering how many viewers had a reaction to #PeggyTheDoll. After hearing her story I couldn't look! #DeadlyPossessions @Zak_Bagans
@Zak_Bagans Felt nothing through the TV. Would not want to be there in same room, though.
#DeadlyPossessions #GAC #GhostAdventures
Bruh when I looked at the doll, I became kinda sad and idk why @Zak_Bagans #DeadlyPossessions
Fuck Peggy. Something ain't right with that doll's face. I looked for 1 second and can't unsee it. I hate scary dolls #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans Peggy has a realistic looking face! @Zak_Bagans #DeadlyPossessions
Peggy the doll made my heart beat faster and I did feel anxious... not sure if it's supernatural or I'm about to faint. 😮 #DeadlyPossessions
What do you think so far? #DeadlyPossessions
Zaks mom is so cute #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans watching the replay of #DeadlyPossessions and when Peggy the doll face was shown me and my wife change the channel lol
Finally watching #DeadlyPossessions and have a question for @Zak_Bagans and @AaronGoodwin. Has peggy the doll affected you since seeing her?
Has Peggy's owner ever gotten sick? If not, why is she protected/immune #GhostAdventures #DeadlyPossessions @Zak_Bagans
@Zak_Bagans zak after this episode of #DeadlyPossessions I'm going to have go watch a kids movie to go to sleep lol thanks 😦
I made it through looking at #peggythedoll #DeadlyPossessions I felt no different after seeing her face
I admit I got a tinge if headache (nothing new)  but I looked her straight in the eye and said she was beautiful. #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans I wasn't taking any chances looking at Peggy. #DeadlyPossessions
#DeadlyPossessions wow!! @Zak_Bagans Peggy had a major effect on you! Scarey!
@GhostAdventures   Peggy the doll. When that  showed.. I really really really did cover my face seriously I did  #DeadlyPossessions
@Zak_Bagans Peggy reminds me of a doll I had as a child. I stared right into her cold, dark eyes. Why does my chest hurt? #DeadlyPossessions
Quote from #DeadlyPossessions  "I need to know what's under this sack " @Zak_Bagans still making girls sigh while cursing his viewers!!🍒🙈
Watching #DeadlyPossessions and hearing the possessed guy gave me the chills! Thanks for introducing me to this show @ittybittyanniee
@Zak_Bagans I almost had a panic attack when the dolls face was shown and then my whole living room got freezing #DeadlyPossessions lol
And once again while I was watching #DeadlyPossessions both phones glitched, Twitter wouldn't load and the Internet crashed... Curious, no?
