Mark Cuban is slowly becoming Jerry Jones
@DickCarlisle @RickFortyOne Exactly! Mark Cuban doesn't give a shit about him when you really think about it. Dirk is a legend
Mark Cuban did a horrible job in surrounding that man with talent when he took that pay cut
Somebody play the Mark Cuban "I'm out" from shark tank
Bet #Dallas lost this bad to #OKC because Mark Cuban was laughing at the #Rockets earlier. The Universe doesn't like you dawg. I'm sayin'.
Mark Cuban instead of investing on shark tank why don't you invest in the Mavericks. They are garbage
We need to start getting players like the Spurs do.
Mark Cuban always wants the big stars to come to Dallas like its LA or NY

Did Mark Cuban sell the Mavericks to OKC? The Thunder have done nothing but own them all night.
@JoshRene34 Two words.... Mark Cuban
I'll never have remorse for Mark Cuban or Dan Gilbert because they played a role in #TheVeto along with David Stearn #Lakers
I have so much respect for dirk and mark Cuban, but really losing by almost 50 in a playoff game, cmon
“It doesn’t matter how many times you have failed, you only have to be right once.”  – Mark Cuban

Mark Cuban after the game: "And for that reason I'm out." #THUNDERvMAVS

This Thunder vs Mavs game is just sad. The score is embarrassing, Mark Cuban looks irritated and Dirk looks like he needs a hug.
@okcthunder leading by 42... mark cuban maaaaad!!! #DALatOKC
@ChaseOliver68 Mark Cuban doesn't give a shit about putting a win team Dirk took less money and this is shit he gets what an embrassment
After the game Mark Cuban should go in the locker room and slap everybody in the face as hard as he can.
Anyone else remember when Mark Cuban shoved Eric Bischoff at Survivor Series 2003?

Just me then.
Crying Jordan/Mark Cuban photos will start to flood timelines in 3, 2, 1...
Mark Cuban cringing in OKC
Mark Cuban is probably enjoying his mavs Lol #NBAPlayoffs
Mark Cuban in the stands looking angry as hell 😂😂😂
Earlier I asked @josh_southam if he thinks Mark Cuban cares more about Shark Tank than the Mavs as a joke, but maybe the joke isn't a joke
Mark Cuban must be pissed #NBAPlayoffs
You need Mark Cuban/Steve Ballmer type owners of all these sports teams. It should be a fun endeavor owning a sports team...
Mark Cuban is nowhere to be found
I guess Mark Cuban is in the Shark Tank tonight.
What's left of him.
#Chum
#ThunderUp
🎣
DIRK A TRUE MARK CUBAN ASS KISSER😂😂
This Mark Cuban fault
Something tells me the #Mavs roster is the way it is because Mark Cuban refuses to have anyone that's not in his #NBA Live 2009 XBOX game...
Someone pls put sad michael face on mark cuban
Mark Cuban mad
I'm not even sure how the Mavericks made the playoffs, Mark Cuban should be ashamed of himself for this constructed roster
If tonight's Mavs were an investment on Shark Tank, Mark Cuban would say no.
Breaking my retirement to ask how Mark Cuban is feeling about the Mavericks game
And Mark Cuban a bitch
the mavericks need to explain this performance to mark cuban on "shark tank"
