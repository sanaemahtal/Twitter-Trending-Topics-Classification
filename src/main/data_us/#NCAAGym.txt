That was a hell of a championship meet. Every team should be proud. #NCAAGym
Actually really disappointed that florida didnt win the #NCAAGym
20 people guessed all six Super Six teams, but no one chose the correct order of finishers (closest was one team off). #NCAAgym
Oklahoma may have won the team title, but they didn't have a gymnast win three individual titles...or any individual titles. :)  #NCAAGym
All four top scores tonight came in the final rotation. #NCAAGym
Omg I want to do that entire floor rotation again. The screaming the jumping the chills the ugly crying as Scaman finishes. #NCAAGym
@uclagymnastics @GatorsGym I couldn't choose a team! I'd have switched pom-pom's all meet long! Great job!üêäüíôüêªüôÉ #NCAAGym #SuperSix

Emotionally conflicted=Tiger ladies finished second place at gymnastics championship. But still beat Bama. #lsugym #NCAAGym
Time to go to sleep. Who needs to be at work on time tomorrow , #NCAAGYM #NotMe
That was definitely the most intense meet I've ever watched.... Oklahoma national champs!üéâ #NCAAGym
WOOOO congrats to OU for winning #NCAAGym
@NCAA The scoring was laughable! #NCAAGym
D-D dancing and bouncing around on the floor and Peng singing into the camera is everything. #NCAAgym
Now that Sloan is done the great debate can begin: Sloan or Kupets? #NCAAGym
Again, why did @OU_WGymnastics grab the trophy prematurely? Like....wait a few minutes.  #NCAAGym
