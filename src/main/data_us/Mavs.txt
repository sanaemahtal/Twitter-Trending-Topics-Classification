As Much As I Got Respect For KD &amp; Russ But I'm Still Ridin &amp; Dyin With Dirk &amp; The Mavs!!!. #Ridin&amp;Dyin #MFFL
@SalazarBrycen  Dirk was the only player on the mavs who scored above 10pts smh
Mavs will bounce back
@TravisBell95 they better... I doubt it... They will whine about the Mavs for an Hour and the draft for an hour
Ik it's only game one but I'm so happy okc got the win hopefully we sweep the mavs
@_artistone_ thunder gonna roll through mavs, then spurs are going to demolish thunder. zzz
Just checked the score for the Mavs-Thunder game and wow is all I got to say.
@Terence_Huie final score: 108-70 😂. I got Mavs in 6 😭😭😭😭
@ESPNNBA The Refs' tonight made the fewest calls they ever have for the Mavs in the postseason due to favoritism of the OKC Thunder
OKC mutted the Mavs.
@Da_real_Rjay ain't too much better to Mavs fan rn either lol
@NBA Poor Mavs should just quit. They're going to get blown out at this rate.
The only upset the Mavs are looking at right now is the tone of their parents' voices
Why #Mavs? &amp; how? Smh
I'm A Mavs Fan but that lost was embarrassing Af 😕💯🚮
Thunder going to sweep the mavs
Just when I change my avi the Mavs lose by 38. 🙈
@meganstiletto that's how I felt about rockets and warriors. But mavs actually have a chance. The rockets dont
Game 1. Thunder 108-70 Mavs.
Kobe (60) vs Mavs (70) would of been a better game! #ThunderUp ⚡️⚡️
This Thunder vs Mavs series might be more one sided than Warriors vs Rockets
I love my mavs but we're gonna get swept
Atleast the Mavs scored more than what Kobe scored in his last game #TeamOKC #NBAPlayoffs #OKCvDAL
Mavs took the pump by 38. Ouch.
Boy that Mavs OKC game was high quality basketball eh NBA truthers. Great playoff game. Maybe the greatest
I don't really watch basketball and I don't really have a favorite team or player. but the MAVS fucking suck..
@ALawRadio more in Dallas care about the stars and Rangers currently the Rangers in spring training had better ratings than a mavs game
Think about it... Mavs played careless defense. Had less turnovers. Just couldn't hit shots. Mavs beat themselves. Shot 30% from the field.
Why the mavs even get into the playoffs. What a pathetic ass performance. Fucken scrubs
The #thunder absolutely embaressed the #Mavs they should just forfeit it was painful to watch there a disgrace !!! #NBAPlayoffs
I don't see any Mavs slander bc I've muted y'all until Monday.
Mavs trash
@justinsrusseIl the rockets and mavs became a joke
We killed the mavs so bad
If your team couldn't make the playoffs, please don't tweet anything about my Mavs.
Thunder really did my mavs like that huh
The mavs got 40 pieced?
#MAVS RT @MFollowill: Thanks to all who tuned in on a long night. We appreciate it and will see you Monday at 7 for G2 on @TXA21

@JeffMcAdamTV yeah no one expects the Mavs to make it past 5... If that.. It's all stars now here! Even local media is on the train!
MAVS ND ROCKETS GOT TOASTED
I told @IAMDJJUS mavs was gonna get SMOKED!! 3'ore games to go for that $100
My poor Mavs got the brakes beat off em today. So shameful.  Love my team regardless
@SPORTalkMavs @swish41 @TheMavsFanatic @jjbareapr @zaza27 @JusAnderson1 @50Mejri @dallasmavs @Mavs_FFL @WessyWes23 @DeronWilliams Monday.
The Mavs should probably score a little more next game
My Mavs took a major L.
@dougman_23 Yeah I agree. I didn't notice the NBA way until the Mavs-Thunder game.
@txfinest152 I've never seen such a dominant offensive performance like the Mavs,seemed like they couldn't miss in the 2nd half
@mikko_leach it's just ball bro, all love on this side. I'll defend the mavs till I die tho lmao 😂
@MattMooreCBS looks like what the Mavs shot tonight.
That Mavs loss was really bad, Dirk doesn't deserve this, and I won't fault him for leaving this team after this season
@Chad_pole @dallasmavs you would rather play a 68 win team when the mavs went 18% and okc only score 26 Spurs would have scored 38 or more
@solodacannon sweeping the mavs
When do we accept that the Mavs franchise is trash all-around outside of Carlisle?
Mavs vs Thunder (0-1)
MVP R.Westbrook(24pts 11ast 5reb)
          K.Durant(23pts 5ast 5reb)
OKC slapped up the Mavs
Best +/- for the Mavs?

JAVALE MCGEE +4
Mavs are trash
OKC really had to do the Mavs like that? 🤔
Real. RT @Mr_Faizon: Mavs in 6
@dallasmavs vs @okcthunder is the biggest waste of a series ever... The mavs wasting their time
The Mavs really got 70 points from 85 shots. Wow. Incredible.
And yet the Rockets still put on a better performance than the Mavs😂😂😂😂😂😂
