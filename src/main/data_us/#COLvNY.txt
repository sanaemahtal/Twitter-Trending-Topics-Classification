.@DenverChannel now my fave sports coverage. Thanks @arranandersen for leading w @ColoradoRapids #COLvNY #SnowClasico2 ! #TheBeautifulGame
Nyc will kick there ass üò†üëä #COLvNY
Wonder what page this is on Ali Curtis master plan or is this a sequel he just started to write??? #NYRB #RBNY #COLvNY
That being said this is a poor sample for any kinda measure really. Outlier game in every way. Only bad b/c it's part of the streak #COLvNY
Aside from the goal the 'quality chances' we've all been pointing to in order to stay optimistic were not really there this game

#COLvNY
If u add @Jermainejunior @s_gashi11 Pappa Williams Miller your squad will be that much stronger, who knew? #COLvNY #Rapids96 #SnowClasico2
The Colorado Rapids becoming a thing.. #MLS #COLvNY
Are #Rapids96 actually decent this year? It seems like it, but I have a hard time believing it. #RBNY #COLvNY #MLS
Win or lose I'm with em to the end #COLvNY #RBNY
@ColoradoRapids @Jermainejunior @dbadji14 Congrats #COLvNY 2-1 #SnowClasico2
Wow, MacMath might be part frozen but delays that kick... #COLvNY ends 2-1. 6th defeat for NY Red Bulls. Jones opens his Rapids account!
Your @ColoradoRapids remain undefeated at home! #Rapids96 #COLvNY #SnowClasico2
Shep, Thierry Henry would be home in front of a fire in PJs &amp; sheepskin slippers, not putting his hammy through an April blizzard #COLvNY
Another phone tweet because #Rapids96 win 2-1! AHJJ got a great assist to go with his goal! #RBNY #COLvNY #MLS
Well that was an interesting game to say the least #COLvNY
Jermaine Jones was excellent in his season debut for the Rapids. Kid might have a future in that #10 role... #COLvNY
@ColoradoRapids WIN AND @Jermainejunior SCORED IN HIS FIRST GAME AHHHHHHüòçüòçüòçüòç‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è #COLvNY #Rapids96 #Snowclasico2
9 points from all three home games so far. Let's make that the norm #Rapids96 #COLvNY
Well that didn't end as I hoped it would... üò≥üò≥üò≥ #COLvNY
Well, that set the sport back about 40 years. #COLvNY
And the poor start for NY continues #COLvNY
Pathetic. #COLvNY
FULL TIME! #Rapids96 win their 3rd in 3 games at DSG Park. 2-1 over #RBNY. @Jermainejunior with a goal and an assist in his debut. #COLvNY
#COLvNY This goalkeeper should be given a yellow for stalling @MLS
Proper drop ball in a pro game. Don't see that often

#COLvNY
Well deserved 3 points!! @ColoradoRapids @C38sg . Great debut for @Jermainejunior !! #MLS #COLvNY

Dont know whats worse. Playing conditions or level of play from NY #COLvNY
The headline should be "Red Bulls Lose Game That Would've Been Called Off In Conference North" #COLvNY
@MLSAnalyst #COLvNY you must be happy that the red Bulls are losing a lot
Just remember folks, the Rapids have a Championship and the MetroBulls don‚Äôt. #COLvNY
6 minutes of stoppage time #COLvNY
Lade was the reincarnation of Roy Miller on that balloon shot to waste all that pressure. #COLvNY
Multiple times tonite the ball has popped back out to the taker on a NY corner. COL slow to get out and keeping them onside 

#COLvNY
Felipe just hit 6 crosses - 2 corners, 4 from run of play. None of them got past the first defender. #COLvNY
Badji is back out there now, seems to be OK. #RBNY really threatening to tie this thing up. 2-1 #Rapids96 90+ #COLvNY 6 minutes added time.
