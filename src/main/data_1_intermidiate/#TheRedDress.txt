@MattCarterMedia Still tweeting about the fabulous #Outlander and #TheRedDress. SNL doesn't air on the west coast for a while yet. :)
So disappointed tonight 😟 Murtagh only high point. Not up to par #TheRedDress @Outlander_STARZ
@TheRonTerryShow Me too!!  :)  #Outlander #TheRedDress
Sigh##TheRedDress
@caitrionambalfe @Outlander_STARZ @SamHeughan Watching fur the third time ! So great! #Outlander #TheRedDress
@emariemac :)  Indeed.  #Outlander #TheRedDress
#TheRedDress is in the house!!! #Outlander She's going to need a bigger fan. 😜
@TheRonTerryShow @Outlander_STARZ Whisky is good too, I drank wine..maybe a little too much🍷🍷🍷#Outlander #TheRedDress
@DebsterPA1 @OutlanderCostum LOL, I'm in my jammies with a shot of whisky in hand!  Tres elegant, aren't we?!  ;) #Outlander #TheRedDress
@OutlanderCostum I have such a propensity for bad timing! #TheRedDress
@june_mar2 We trended with #TheRedDress and #Murtagh-but we were not going for trending we were going for ratings Nielsen-we will see those
@TheRonTerryShow @Outlander_STARZ Have a glass of wine and enjoy the episode #Outlander #TheRedDress
#TheRedDress is the most beautiful costume I've seen on @Outlander_STARZ &amp; that's really saying something! @draiochta14 @caitrionambalfe ❤️
@Outlander_STARZ I. LOVE. THAT. DRESS!!! And @caitrionambalfe is so absolutely stunning in it!!! #JeSuisPrest #TheRedDress #Outlander
Can I see more of #TheRedDress
Jaime having a heart attack. #TheRedDress
What #TheRedDress
And that's it for #TheRedDress, the shoes, the epic genius of Murtaugh, and the rest of Ep 202!! #Outlander #LiveTweetwithMOP
Missed the 9pm airing of #Outlander with #TheRedDress but I am going to watch it now. Ah pjs, warm bed and @Outlander_STARZ love it!
Saw this months ago...pretty sure its blue. #TheRedDress
@LaniDianeRich @storywonk size of preg Claire didn't bother me at all. I only gained 17# my 1st preg &amp; could have easily worn #TheRedDress
@draiochta14 loved the costumes tonight on #outlander and the #TheRedDress was gorgeous as was all of your designs tonight 👍💕
The music was perfect when Claire came down the stairs in #TheRedDress #outlander @bearmccreary @Outlander_STARZ
Ah, Murtaugh is foreshadowing with Sandringham. #TheRedDress
Any similarity between Monsieur Duverney and Pepe La Pew is purely coincidental #TheRedDress
@ClanHeughan yes really!! Lol!! #Outlander #TheRedDress ❤️👠❤️👠❤️
