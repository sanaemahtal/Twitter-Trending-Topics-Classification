Watching #Confirmation. I remember watching the trial and thinking how brave #AnitaHill was then. #hero
Anita Hill was so brave. It must have been terrifying to testify in front of the Senate with  so much scrutiny #Confirmation
I don't remember a lot about the #Confirmation hearings, but I remember folks saying Anita Hill betrayed the black race by accusing Thomas.
"So much power, so little leadership." â€” #Confirmation
outrage is an understatement for what I am feeling after watching #Confirmation
#Confirmation There was a lynching then, but it wasn't Clarence Thomas
#Confirmation #AnitaHill I missed it ðŸ˜”
Such a great shot of men in the barbershop  #Confirmation
#Confirmation #HBO The movie is actually pretty good and it's absurd that we still let Justice Thomas on the court after these allegations
What a shocker- republicans refusing to believe the survivor of harassment and instead making her the villain #Confirmation #AnitaHill
Between @jonronson's Monica Lewinsky article &amp; Anita Hill #Confirmation, it's been a helluva day for pilloried women in the 90s.

Also crazy: that they waited for the black guy to retire before, and then HAD TO, appoint another black guy #Confirmation
I don't know if I can finish #Confirmation disgusted in #ClarenceThomas playing the race card &amp; the committee using politics in harrassment
And, I will admit that seeing #Confirmation has made me lose some respect for Biden.
StudioQTV: Great seeing IAMJHUD and iKimberlyElise in #confirmation
Just watched #Confirmation and now I'm pissed.
Watching the #Confirmation, remember being upset when I watched it in real time ~ now, I'm even more upset by the all white, all male panel
Ugh. Here comes that "high-tech lynching" bullshit. #Confirmation
