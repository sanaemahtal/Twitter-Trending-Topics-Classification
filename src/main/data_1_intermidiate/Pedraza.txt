at least pedraza beat the brit
@dianamendoza62 I will but you're still a junior so... We can wait until August
Whoaaa, just watched my dude Jose Pedraza box the shit out of a little white boy. I love television violence.
@toptroweltony @SHOsports @sniper_pedraza I agree with that. But it's not just a USA thing, it's a boxing thing.
@DayBurns23 turned the fight didn't it mate. When Ste was getting in and out Pedraza looked lost la. Got a great jab Pedraza to be fair like
@EddieHearn was a easy fight to predict. People were sleeping on Pedraza
I'd like to see Pedraza back in August and in New York. #boxing
Big names get all the attention but there is some quality world champions like Pedraza who don't get as much attention as fake belt holdersü§î
@monch915 @SHOsports @sniper_pedraza not at all I'm saying that there is that much corruption in USA boxing,away fighter never wins
@loudibella @sniperpedraza @eaner0919 Liked the look of Pedraza. Huge at the weight, nice skills and piping fit.
Puerto Rico should get behind jose Pedraza they got a great little fighter there @loudibella
Sky Sports reckons Pedraza is the best 130lb champion, Smith can win a title vs the WBA, WBO,WBC champions. Smith wont beat any of them
@premierboxing @sniper_pedraza @SwiftySmith EZ fight 4 the champ. would of liked 2 c him b more aggressive &amp; finish. #NotImpressed
Been a good #FightNight so far. #pedraza outclassing smith. Hoping it continues in the next matchup.
@adbennoEFC gutted that pedraza looks quality
@iam_yafai @SwiftySmith that Pedraza was a tricky customer , full credit to swifty he done good an announced himself on world stage üëç
Selby just said Jose Pedraza was one of the best his seen for a long time. As far as World Champions go Pedraza is bang on average.
@roberts_dano @MatchroomBoxing finished mate Pedraza points !
Done well there, give everything. Pedraza class tho
Pedraza is a quality fighter too. Smith give it a great go and was always in the fight #SkyBoxing
@EddieHearn @SwiftySmith Great performance by Pedraza.  Still believe Swifty will become a world champ in the future, showed a lot of heart!
@toptroweltony @SHOsports @sniper_pedraza @SwiftySmith but he didn't even knock him down once. R u saying he got robbed?

#PedrazaSmith
@stacksparadox @sniper_pedraza @loudibella was a great performance. Solid Champion
@JoshWoogs Pedraza too good, think he beats Selby?
Pedraza is average. Smith isn't even that good &amp; hindered by a fucking spastic in his corner. Both irrelevant at 130.
Quality fighter that pedraza, unlucky @SwiftySmith fella
Gutted for Swifty...
Definitely showed he's world class after that though! Pedraza is a legitimate world champion, more to come from Swifty!
Congratulations to both @sniper_pedraza @SwiftySmith that was an excellent fight. The Champion needed to use all his experience. @SHOsports
Hard tough fight but @SwiftySmith will come again. Good fight, the knockdown was crucial. Pedraza looks a good champ. #PedrazaSmith
Pedraza vs Walters would bee a good fight next
@JamesHelder_ until the 9th it was very even. He can easily come again pedraza very good champion
Was a decent effort from #Smith. But #Pedraza is a real slick operator #PedrazaSmith #Boxing
@EddieHearn @SwiftySmith get pedraza in Liverpool Eddie üëä #rematch
@p_mcallister123 there were some tight rounds, only 1 winner though. The rounds smith won were tight, the ones pedraza won were clear.
Gutted for @SwiftySmith. More than held his own tonight, just the knockdown swung it back in Pedraza's favour. He'll be back. Brave effortüëäüèº
Good fight and pedraza just to slick. Unlucky swifty lad
Still don't think Pedraza is all that
@EddieHearn @SwiftySmith great fight..rematch? Bring Pedraza over here?
Pedraza did what he was supposed to do including the mandatory #ThankAlHaymon. #Boxing
@Alex__Kenny I had Pedraza by 1, and could have seen how people could give Pedraza another, but by 7???
Unlucky Smith, great effort. Pedraza just pulled away towards the end of the fight. #PedrazaSmith
Unlucky Swifty, looked like it was turning his way until the knockdown. All Pedraza's then.
Brave performance from @SwiftySmith who lost to a very good champion there. Pedraza was well-prepared and that knockdown was pivotal #boxing
Had it level until Pedraza got the knockdown.. great fight - you'll come again, head up mate @SwiftySmith #PedrazaSmith
Had it Pedraza by 1/2 rounds 7 s a joke and 5 just ant giving @SwiftySmith the credit he deserves  #skyboxing
Good effort from Stephen Smith but better performance and good win for Jose Pedraza.
Good work translating the final portion of the interview, Mr. Jim Gray. @sniper_pedraza #boxing @SHOsports
That's what you gotta do, Pedraza. Fight, speak, smile. I like it.
Pedraza gained a lot of the respect he lost after the cherry fight tonight beating smith. Still Pedraza &gt; Verdejo in my book.
@BillyDib @sniper_pedraza @loudibella guess I was wrong. Congratulations to Sniper. Good performance tonight
Done well there smith, that pedraza is hard to catch clean
Cards a little too wide there for me but thought Pedraza showed his class throughout! Still think @SwiftySmith wins a world title though!
Smith just not good enough #pedraza much better #PedrazaSmith different levels
"I had a better camp. It was long. We worked on bettering my abilities." -Pedraza #boxing #PedrazaSmith
Had Pedraza by 3 at the end
@EddieHearn Pedraza just too slick no shame in losing to that.
Get in Pedraza!!!
Somebody is going to figure out #Pedraza sooner rather than later nothing too special here. #PedrazaSmith
@BetOnBoxing911 LOL, 3 or so rds. If I give the 12th to Pedraza which he came on, then it would be 116-111
@DeBlaz @SwiftySmith @sniper_pedraza Good fight.
Smith can be very proud of himself tonight. Pedraza too good in the end.
"I connected a good punch but I knew he was ok. That's why I came so prepared." -Pedraza #boxing #PedrazaSmith
Pedraza reminds me of Cotto's mood &amp; attitude lol
#SPIKESN The winner of this bout and still #IBFJuniorLightweightChampion, @sniper_pedraza!
#ShowtimeBoxing #PedrazaSmith
Jose Pedraza is a solid fighter. Too bad he has very little following in Puerto Rico or on the East Coast (USA) .. #boxing #PedrazaSmith
