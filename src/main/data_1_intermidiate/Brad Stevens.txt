Brad Stevens is a pretty good coach.
@Thecorleoneway idk about we I'm a laker fan I hate Boston lmao but I love the talent they got and Brad Stevens the homie
Any NBA superstar free agent that wants to win a title and not just join a super team, get on the Celtics and play for Brad Stevens...
NOOOOOO "@celtics: Brad Stevens on Avery Bradley: "No update. I saw Avery. He’s very, very sore. He said on the court that he heard a pop.""
@Brad_CoOl_Hands even though they lost if it wasn't for Brad Stevens and the talent he has brought in they would be ass
Coach of year (top 5)1. Steve Kerr2. Terry Stotts3. Brad Stevens4. Luke Walton5. Gregg Popovich
not even a cCeltics fan but Brad Stevens is the best coach in the NBA.
@CapptainDOPE I like the c's. Brad Stevens is a great coach. I just don't think they match up very well with atl
@Dspohn388 I ❤️ Brad Stevens
shockingly bad coaching by Brad Stevens in the last 2 minutes of #BOSvsATL
@ESPNForsberg and the "great" brad stevens still sits at 0 career playoff wins.Pathetic.
@ChrisMannixYS @jt894 @TheVertical @celtics Brad Stevens will be a good coach
@MikeyAdamsWEEI remind us how many career playoff wins brad stevens has.
Brad Stevens is 0-5 in playoff games
I'll never be able to think of the name Brad Stevens without thinking of "Dice" now. If you watch the show you'll know why.
If Brad Stevens never got that tech we would've seen OT.
The Knicks need to find a gem like Brad Stevens.
It's a testament to Brad Stevens that he got 48 wins out of this average roster. Celtics will be great when they upgrade the roster.
Brad stevens just said Avery Bradley told him "he heard a pop"when hurt his hamstring. NO BUENO.
Brad Stevens is great but him not putting Smart on Teague is puzzling.
@michael_barber3 @RickThorp1 absolutely not a chance Brad Stevens will be leaving Boston if it's under the Celtics control lol
Brad Stevens just said Avery Bradley told him he "heard a pop" when hurt his hamstring. Not good.

. head coach Brad Stevens on NBA TV now! ...this series is shaping up to be a good one. #NBAPlayoffs ��
@tallskinnyben Boston has got a lot of heart and my coach of the year in Brad Stevens. I honestly love rooting for the underdog.
Thanks to the 2015 NBA COY Mike Budenholzer, the Hawks didn't score only 5 pts on 3rd QT after another amazing comeback from Brad Stevens...
@Jimmie_Knows crazy. Gotta credit Brad Stevens. Guy is a damn genius for his age
@thebubbaunit Brad Stevens has made us relevant one disappointment won't cost him his job, he's a great coach
