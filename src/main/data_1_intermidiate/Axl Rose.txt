Its not 4/1 and its not a joke that Axl Rose is the new lead singer of AC/DC......
It turns out Axl Rose won the #USAeroPressChampionship. Congrats! I think I got that right.
I can't really picture Axl Rose fronting AC/DC, so this will be interesting... #LRT
AXL ROSE IS TOO OLD TO BE TRENDING BECAUSE I WAS VERY WORRIED FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS THAT I HAD KILLED HIM BY MENTIONING HIM IN CONVERSATION.
@SonnyBoneSuplex , What that Axl Rose has The Lead Vocal Spot? I can't do anything but wait until after the 10 dates...
@dolphinblows whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat? I LOVE AXL ROSE BUT WHY?
Wow haha RT @YahooMusic AC/DC Confirm Axl Rose Is New Lead Singer, Joining Band on Tour
Is it bad that I kind of want to go see AC/DC with Axl Rose on vocals?
Wait, Axl Rose is now the lead singer to AC/DC? ... Is this real life?
Axl Rose is fronting AC/DC for the remainder of their US and Europe tour. Ew.
@ONENewsNZ Did you know Axl rose is the new lead singer for AC/DC  just started trending on twitter
Axl Rose (Guns N' Roses) &gt; AC / DC. #Fichajes (?)
Axl Rose joining ACDC going to be interesting how this turns out.
Axl Rose is pretty much the perfect singer for AC/DC. He's probably the closest thing to Bon Scott there is. #Rock #ACDC
Unholy combinations:

1 Taco Bell Waffle Quesarito 
2 AC/DC with Axl Rose
@EddieTrunk @axlrose saw GnR in Vegas. I was impressed with axl's range after all this time. I am fascinated by the ac/dc-axl rose tour.
I am so not seeing Axl Rose as AC/DC's new frontman. Ozzy would've been a more plausible choice. Or maybe Keith Richards just for giggles.
@CorianderRN Yes. Axl Rose is the new front man for AC/DC.
It's official - Axl Rose in for Brian Johnson. @acdc have four substitutions left under current #AFL rules.
You know where you are?  
You're at an AC/DC concert, baby!  
You're gonna DIIIIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!!!!!

So, is Axl Rose still a douche?
AC/DC with Axl Rose behind the mic? Yeah, nah. That'd be like Iron Maiden using someone like Blaze Bayley
Axl Rose as the new lead singer of AC/DC seems to be conclusive evidence for the @pattonoswalt Wacky Universe Theory.
@punkrocksellout @NickinDallas @juice005 So Axl Rose is the new lead singer of AC‚ö°Ô∏èDC now that Johnson can't perform live. That's insane

Axl Rose... AC/DC? What? #ACDC #AxlRose
@ChrisLomonaco98 @andrewlambert_9 you realize Axl Rose tore Guns n' Roses apart and destroyed one of the best bands of all time
