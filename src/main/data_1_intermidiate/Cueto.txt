@SFGiants The shape of our bullpen can't be trusted with a 1-run lead. They should've let Cueto finish the game.
Somehow I managed to weave bagel bites, arroz con leche, and Isa Cueto into my portfolio. It's going to be great üòè
I run ahead of the Dodgers. If Casilla comes in, G-Men need more runs. Go #SFGiants! #BeatLA.....Or will Cueto finish the game?
@carmenkiew You're already working on the Cueto praying GIF, right?
@SFGiants Nice job taking CUETO out, smart move!!
romo (and #CUETO) say: f*ck yeah! #BeatLA
@SPORTalkSFGiant Cueto did so well.  Hope Osish do the job.
Cueto has gotta be pissed. #BeatLA
@SFGiants @AlexPavlovic Way to pitch Cueto!!üí™üëçüëè #WeAreSF #WeAreGiant #gianttogether #beatLA
Win this for Cueto and The Skipper. #BeatLA
@Lana That horse should be named Johnneigh Cueto.
Come on Bullpen. Don't rob Cueto of the W! #SFGiants
Cueto's sitting there saying "I am so using this opt out clause"
Cueto is PISSED
@carmenkiew Cueto getting Cained.
Come on, Hunter. Don't let Cueto down.
Johnny Cueto watching his win slip through his fingers after an outstanding performance. You're a Giant now, buddy!
Come on bullpen, give Cueto that W. He deserved it. #SFGiants
Cueto pitches a brilliant game. #SFGiants just need 5 outs and bullpen screws the pooch.
Cueto gets pulled ... giants BP immediately gives up a BOMB
@JeffPassan I heard him mis-pronounce Cueto for the last 2 hours.
OMG Bochy is going to ruin Cueto's arm .April...105 pitches and coming out to pitch 8th.This after sore arm last yr.  SAD/TRAGIC
#/s
@DeeJaySeanG did they take Cueto out cuz of pitch count?
We were doing so well! And it happens right when you take out Cueto!
The Giants pen better not blow this! Cueto pitched a great game too. #SFGiants
Cueto is such a G. Love that guy!
Let Cueto finish! #sfgiants
7 Ks for #Giants Johnny Cueto on the night! Great third start for the RHP.
Seriously Lopez should of just kept Cueto in the whole 8th
Welp kinda thinking that cueto should've stayed in #BeatLA
@WesMillsRadio 4-3 bitttttches!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cueto's face = everything!
Cueto is taking this well
Should've let Cueto finish the inning and go straight to Casilla in the 9th
Just keep the lead for Cueto #SFGiants
That was for everyone wondering why Bochy left Cueto in for so long
Should've let Cueto in smh
Way to fuck up Cueto's outing... #SFGiants
Maybe Cueto should have stayed inüò≥&amp; what's happened to Javy? #BeatLa #SFGiants
You just burnt Cueto Mr. Relief. #SFGiants
Cueto lookin like i did all that for what?
I think Bochy took Cueto out too soon. #SFGiants #BeatLA
