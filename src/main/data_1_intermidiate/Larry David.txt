vote for Bernie Sanders if you want Larry David to be a full time cast member at SNL!!
I wonder how much Larry David has helped Bernie Sanders campaign visibility on #SNL
Larry David as Bernie Sanders on SNL never gets old.
I‚Äôm always so happy for @Seinfeld2000 when a Seinfeld related actor or Larry David shows up anywhere.
@nbcsnl LARRY DAVID!!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
On #SNL, black is the new Jewish (except for Larry David. He's still Jewish and funny without being black).
.@nbcsnl #SNL #BrooklynDebate #heroinAM #LIJewelery #PoolBoy #CinemaClassics #MercedesAA all killed. Larry David,Tony Hale,Nick Jonas cameos
@frankrichny @OfficialJLD @VeepHBO fun to see her with Larry David
the amount of #Seinfeld references made in the @nbcsnl opening monologue was great - Larry David as Bernie Sanders remains amazing
Larry David and I are basically the same. Why won't he ever acknowledge me though?
I just started hysterically crying because I imagined being larry david's daughter
I think Larry David has been one SNL more times this season than some of the cast members!
@wycam1 I don't know. I think the writers changed after Larry David hosted because it's been downhill sense
@Mediaite @katiecouric No! Larry David was the reason I started liking Bernie! He makes Bernie likable, and harmless-seeming. Bern is not!
ALPS Food Store Late Models A-Main (Top 5): Todd McCoin, Larry Ferris, Chris Smyser, Bobby Penney, David Melloway
If I ever have the chance to meet Larry David I will not try to be cool I will be doing everything I can to marry him
Larry David is such a BASTARD for not having a Seinfeld reunion. But I love him so much.
Kate Mckinnen is perfect as Hilary and Larry David is perfect as Bernie.
@ureallykicking When I saw the photo i thought it was Larry David
Just saw the SNL Cold Opening.  I MUCH prefer Larry David's version of Sanders to Sanders himself.
Omg. @OfficialJLD and Larry David as Elaine Benes and Bernie on @nbcsnl at the debate. More please.  More.
I only want Bernie to stay in the race so Larry David continues to show up on #SNL
I guess #SNL is better when they have people who know how to do comedy.  Like Larry David and Julia Louis-Dreyfus!
Sometimes I feel like Larry David
So who did the writing the last time Larry David appeared? Bring them back #SNL
Larry David plays a great Bernie Sanders.
You know the writing on SNL is bad when not even Larry David and Julia Louis-Dreyfus can make it funny.
Larry David as Bernie &amp; The Weekend Update are the best parts of #SNL.
Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing Elaine Benes while Larry David plays Bernie Sanders. Win win win
Having Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Larry David in the same sketch was pretty fun. Especially with all the Seinfeld references.
So far, @officialjld is killing it on #SNL. Then again, the political cold opens this season have been solid - especially with Larry David!
Larry David &amp; Julia Louis-Dreyfus I can't üòçüëåüèª
I am dying with @OfficialJLD again as Elaine Benes. I love this @nbcsnl episode. Also, but that's known, I adore Larry David.
@nbcsnl Larry David killing it! #SNL is always on point yada yada yada
@williambwest if the SNL Fantasy League had been going this year, guessing "Larry David" would have let you clean up!
"I always talk like I'm on the other side of a river." -Larry David as Bernie #SNL
Not feeling Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Larry David working together. It just felt forced.
Larry David has been given more to do this season than actual cast-member Sasheer Zamata.
I knew #SNL would open up with a dem debate smit with Larry David.
#SNL Larry David should be considered a feature player this season. @nbcsnl #BernieSanders
Larry David's Bernie Sanders on SNL is absolutely perfect.
Larry David as Bernie Sanders on #SNL crushes it every single time.
Larry David is a terrible Bernie Sanders.
Always a good time when Larry David is on SNL.
Can Larry David just run for President so we can skip the rest of the primaries/the whole election season? #SNL
I want Bernie Sanders to win just so Larry David will be on SNL for the next four years.
Bernie Sanders has been a godsend for Larry David's career! #SNL
We get it, #SNL, you want Hillary to win. You even got Elaine and Larry David to say it. SIGH.
@ShiyuanWang JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS, LARRY DAVID, AND COLIN JOST. This is the god damn dream team.
Larry David does a better Bernie Sanders then Bernie himself.
One thing that Julia Louis Dreyfus left out in her opening host monologue was her time being on "Seinfeld" with Larry David. #SNL
larry david 2016
Larry David as Bernie, Kate McKinnon as Hillary, &amp; @OfficialJLD reprising Elaine from #Seinfeld. Tonight's #SNL opening was perfect! üòÇüëè
HAHA. (Bernie) Larry David, "eeeeeegggeeeeeeee, you should vote for her." #FeelTheBern(NOPE) #TrumpTheBern
@nbcsnl With new unofficial cast member: Larry David.
Julia Louis Dreyfus hosting #SNL with a Larry David cameo is just the greatest thing ever.
