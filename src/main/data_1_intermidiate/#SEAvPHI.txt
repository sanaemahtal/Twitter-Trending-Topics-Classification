Schmid: "You can't score your second one until you score your first one...there's a big weight off his [Morris'] shoulders." #SEAvPHI
Fun fact: it's been a minute since multiple Seattle teams won on the same day #SEAvPHI #NYYvsSEA

Morris the future scored, I'm happy #SEAvPHI
I'll never understand why the mena line is longer than the women's line at the lavs. #SEAvPHI. @ DesinerOG
YEAAAH! Congrats @SoundersFC #SEAvPHI
#SEAvPHI Where did the ref leave his seeing eye dog during the match?  I hope he is able to reunite with him or her. #servicedogsrule
I'm so so glad #SEAvPHI
Ivanschitz quietly gets 2 assists. He was good tonight.#SEAvPHI
.@SoundersFC with the win and Morris with his first goal! #SEAvPHI
I hate to interrupt, but JMo should have been Man of the Match. #motm #SEAvPHI
Not happy with a loss, but it wasn't a "why the fuck did I waste my time?" loss. Team played with heart. #SEAvPHI #DOOP
Way 2 win this 1 @SoundersFC!! #SEAvPHI #WON4US!!
Well, that could'a gone worse, but should'a gone better. Back home next week and should definitely get all 3. @PhilaUnion #SEAvPHI #DOOP
I CAN DIE HAPPY NOW @JmoSmooth13 #SEAvPHI
0 points for @PhilaUnion but a lot learned about ourselves. Every season will have loses, but we looked strong despite the score. #SEAvPHI
i mean... i'm sad that we lost. but i'm not despondent. that was a hard-fought game. #SEAvPHI
That's all from me, @TobyDunk, here in Seattle. Stay tuned for our Timbers v San Jose coverage. #SEAvPHI
Even though @PhilaUnion lost, they didn't give up being down a man and 2 goals. Pulled 1 back, not enough time for the equalizer. #SEAvPHI
Sounders Win! Wished for a shutout but we'll take the points. 2-1 #SEAvPHI #GoSounders
Cascadia 1-1 tonight with Timbers leading SJ 1-0. #SEAvPHI 2-1 (FT) #RSLvVAN 1-0 (FT) #PORvSJ 1-0 (2nd Half)
Scared to think what philly could've brought with a full squad for 90'. I see why they're doing well. #SEAvPHI
A man down, Philly fall in Sounders territory. Goals by: Marshall, Morris (his first MLS goal) and Le Toux. #SEAvPHI

The #Sounders pick up 3 big points with a 2-1 win over the Union.  Jordan Morris scores his first #MLS goal.  #SEAvPHI
Wow Alonso getting a card too bad it's 30 minutes late and the wrong color. #SEAvPHI
Full time in Seattle, 2-1 Sounders over the Union. Marshall gets second of season, Morris gets first of his career with game-winner #SEAvPHI
That referee got snookered by the Union players, sad. #SEAvPHI
Blake up for Philly! Union can't convert set piece and ref blows fulltime whistle, 2-1 Seattle! #EBFG #SEAvPHI
This ref is throwing up cards like heâ€™s singing a goddamn Coldplay song.

#SFCMOTM @Stefan24Frei Super Stefan saves the day again #SEAvPHI
Aw, referee, king of being wrong. #SEAvPHI
95' Union free kick just outside the 18 yard box. #SEAvPHI
95' Union free kick just outside the 18 yard box. #SEAvPHI
A win and goals from @ChadMarshall14 and @JmoSmooth13?! Can't get much better than that. #SEAvPHI
Absolute crap 1-sided officiating + yet the @PhilaUnion played like warriors all game. #SEAvPHI
Yellow card to Alonso after kicking the ball away in frustration after disagreeing with a call #SEAvPHI
It wouldn't have been his 200th if Ozzie hadn't picked up a yellow. Now he has. Seconds left #SEAvPHI
94' Union free kick and everyone goes forward. Ball popped out. #SEAvPHI

Are these commentators blind? That was an obviously bad foul by Valdez and they are trying to justify it #SEAvPHI
Like Herc's energy. #SEAvPHI #soundersfc
Hercu-geez. Get it together. #SEAvPHI
@TaylorTwellman Given how PRO has been calling it - That Valdez yellow should have been red, no? About as "studs up" as can be #SEAvPHI
91' Seattle counter and Hercules Gomez knocks it wide of the Union goal. Still 2-1 Seattle #SEAvPHI

Come on Union score a goal, it's really very simple. Put the ball into the net and we'll go fucking mental! #SEAvPHI
Gomez with a perfect chance to seal it, but his sliding touch skirts around and behind the goal. #SEAvPHI
5 minutes!? I! #SEAvPHI #comeontheu
5 min stoppage???? #SEAvPHI
90' Five minutes of stoppage time added. Time for the Union to make something happen #SEAvPHI
It should be 3-1. #SEAvPHI #soundersfc
This does not include the extra time minutes you miss. Insane. #SEAvPHI
Overhead on the broadcast: "It better be five [minutes of stoppage time]" #SEAvPHI
The announcement of five minutes of stoppage time is met by boo's from the Seattle crowd. #SEAvPHI
That was a soft yellow. 

#SoundersFC #SEAvPHI
Referee has been solid tonight, it must be said. #SEAvPHI
5 more minutes for the Union to equalize #SEAvPHI
