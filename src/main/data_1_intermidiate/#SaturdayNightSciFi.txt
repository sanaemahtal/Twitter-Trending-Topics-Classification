NEtflix recommends Unforgiven. That seems right... Moody sci-fi noir to moody western. #SaturdayNightSciFi #BladeRunner

Light hurts the #aliens ! They are ugly creatures! #Riddick #pitchblack #saturdaynightscifi
Origami also shows up in Man in the High Castle, which is also based on PK Dick story #BladeRunner #SaturdayNightSciFi
Deeply enjoyed this!  #SaturdayNightSciFi #bladerunner
...because fuck that happy ending-feel good bullshit at the end of the theatrical. #SaturdayNightSciFi
This awful tacked on ending is out takes from the opening scene of The Shining when the fam is driving to Overlook Hotel #SaturdayNightSciFi
@pomwonderland My HAIR!! :-))) #SaturdayNightSciFi #BladeRunner
This film is brilliant. I just wish Black people weren't erased from this + many sci-fi futures. #BladeRunner #SaturdayNightScifi
Now I can't wait to watch AMCs Humans season 2. Or the original Real Humans. #SaturdayNightSciFi #BladeRunner
There's the famous origami unicorn. In the theatrical, its just Gaffe's calling card. Here... its the final clue. #SaturdayNightSciFi
I know why there weren't any black women in this rainy ass city. #saturdaynightscifi
Hmmm so that's how you check to see if someone is alive. Got it.  #SaturdayNightSciFi #bladerunner
I'll never forget how this film made me feel, first time I saw it, and fairly young. Opened my mind. #SaturdayNightSciFi #BladeRunner
