@MelE5150 they stalled way too much, even the ref stopped them to tell them to fight, it was very disappointing #Bellator152

When I checked in on #Bellator152 COPS was on. Are they trying to hype up a War Machine return? @MMARoasted
#Bellator152 absolutley sucked tonight,that fight with pitbull was a total disgrace #boofest
Congrats @PatrickyPitbull on UD W.See you for the rematch if it happens. Great night of fights @BellatorMMA @SpikeSports #Bellator152 Italy!
Every fight was spectacular, @PatrickyPitbull needed to unload but I could see the respect was mutualüëäüèºwith these fighters.  #Bellator152
#Bellator152 main event SUCKED
Great to see @MonsterEnergy logo placement on the cage mat for @BellatorMMA 152 #Bellator152: #Torino #Italy live on @SpikeSports @spike!
Omg patricky pit bull failed at putting a great main event #Bellator152
I really respect and appreciate @jimmysmithmma commentary. A straight shooter. #MMA #Bellator152
#Bellator152 asif iv stayed awake for this haha ill will put your feet up these are bums
Btw, why did Alessio Sakara need a translator? I thought he spoke functional English? #Bellator152
What a boring ass fight that was #Bellator152
4-1 for #Bellator152 86-57 on the year. 60%
Really good fights tonight #Bellator152
Genuinely the worst MMA fight I've ever witnessed! #Bellator152
@BellatorMMA that was one of the most BORING fights I've EVER seen, @JohnMcCarthyMMA must've had trouble staying awake lol #Bellator152
Having a hard time staying awake after that.. #Bellator152
Both are losers #Bellator152
Bellator is a joke. Free agency and signing with them is about the stupidest thing fighters could do.  #Bellator152
Clean sweep for Freire.  Souza did not look good in his Bellator debut. 30-27 Pitbull #Bellator152
I usually like watching pitbull but that #bellator152 main eveent was the most boring fight i've watched in full in a while
Well that fight was garbage. #Bellator152
That #Bellator152 main event was the opposite of the #UFCTampa one...
Pitbull won, but with some garbage fighting #terrible #Bellator152
Sorry Excuse For A Main Event üòí #Bellator152 #MMA
30-27 Freire. What an awful fight #Bellator152 @MMADecisions
And this fight was so weak I honestly don't give a damn who won smh that was awful #Bellator152
This should be a draw based on how bad this "main event" was #snoozefest #Bellator152
PitBull Round 3
#Bellator152 #MMA
Patricky needs to keep going for those takedowns #Bellator152
Would anyone even consider this a fight I'd barely call it a sparring match #Bellator152
this #bellator152 main event is boring af
Pitbull couldn't even knock him out smh #Bellator152
@jimmysmithmma man this main event is boring my friend lol,don't know if I've EVER seen 2 guys stand and "shadow box" this much #Bellator152
Wow! This is borderline embarrassing. #Bellator152
Fuck this fight #Bellator152
Has anything happened in that main event of #bellator152
Wake me when this extremely dull #Bellator152 "main event" is over.
RD 2 also goes to Pitbull off the takedown.  Souza just isn't doing anything.  Really surprised by that. 20-18 Pitbull  #Bellator152
20-18 Freire but I wouldn't argue with a 10-10 that round #Bellator152
Two rounds down, who's going to pull this one out? #Bellator152
So this is the main event huh? Smh horribly boring fight so far IMO #Bellator152
What a lackluster fight #Bellator152
this fight is literal garbage #Bellator152
PitBull Round 2
#Bellator152 #MMA
This is the most nervous fight I've seen in a while #bellator152
What a garbage main event #terriblefight #Bellator152
Also new #P2TFRADIO will premiere w/#UFCTampa, #Bellator152 talk &amp; me ranting about failed drug tests in #MMA
Matt Mitrione was pretty good #notsomuch #Bellator152
Souza needs to do something to show he deserved to be here #Bellator152
#Bellator152
Thank u Big John. Tell them to FIGHT! On another note Sakara did work!
Big John Almost Died Of Boredom! #Bellator152 #MMA
You know the main event is good when the crowd is silent for long periods of time #garbagefight #Bellator152
That was weird. McCarthy stopped the fight to tell them to start fighting. Not  sure I've seen that before #Bellator152
You can't force guys to fight doesn't work like that #Bellator152
Not a very exciting 2nd round. #Bellator152
Just saw @YankovaAn fight for the first time..not sure where I been, but wow, very impressive #Bellator152
Quit trolling the hashtag and let people enjoy the main event, you inconsiderate cunt.
@tysillaol #bellator152
#BELLATOR152 #FOXFIGHTCLUB 10-9 KEVIN
Love how @tysillaol's goal is to tell people #bellator152 isn't live. Bitch we know it isn't live but we also don't want the fucking results
He really didn't do much, but I'll give RD 1 to Pitbull.  Souza landed a good shot, but that was pretty much it.  #Bellator152
10-9 Freire #Bellator152
PitBull Round 1
#Bellator152 #MMA
Patricky a huge 155er? He's shorter than Souza, who's a 145er normally... #Bellator152
