I need more #MMA fans on here! #UFCTampa #Bellator152
Any thoughts on #UFCTampa? The only fight I was really interested in was @danhendo vs Machida. Shame! Also, @SugaRashadEvans was too timid!
What are the chances that Glover retired Rashad tonight? #UFCTampa
Successful #UFCTampa :
Zaleski ðŸ’°
Bamgbose ðŸ‘Ž
Graves ðŸ’°
Pennington ðŸ’°
Chiesa ðŸ’°
Namajunas ðŸ’°
Glover Teixiera's KO of Rashad Evans is being slightly undermined by everyone saying Evans should retire. #UFCTampa
Just watched #UFCTampa. Good stuff. 

That's all I got

Congrats to @TeamKhabib as he mauled his way to another dominant victory #Comeback #OverdueTitleShot #UFCTampa
Khabib fights once in 2 years, beats a newcomer and now wants to wait 6 months for a title shot? That's crazy. #UFCTampa
Just got home from #UFCTampa, first live event, bizarre experience. Great fights though, had a lot of fun. Thanks to all the fighters.
Boy, do I regret sticking around the television for that #Bellator152 main event. After 6 hours of #UFCTampa, that was painful. Goodnight.
I can't believe I missed #UFCTampa on FOX, watching #CNN's stale news &amp; #PBConNBC.ðŸ˜¡

A "rear naked choke" sounds kinda porny. #UFCTampa
@UFCONFOX 1 word: Retirement #UFConFox19 #UFCTampa #ShadFace
I missed it what happened tonight #UFCTampa
Congrats to @RockyPMMA on the win tonight! #UFCTampa
@SugaRashadEvans my advice is that you move on and invest in training facilities and maybe, restaurants. Your legacy is secured.  #UFCTampa
